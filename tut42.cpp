Create 2 classes:

                        Take input of 2 numbers using a utility function and perfoms
                         +,-,*,/ and display the results using another function.
        2=ScientificCalculator:
                        Take input of 2 numbers using a utility function and perfoms
                        any four scientific operation of your chioice and display the
                        results using another function.

Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using this 2 classes
Question 1=What type of inheritance are you using?
Question 2=Which mood of inheritance are you usiing?
Question 3=Create an object of HybridCalculator and display reuslts of simple
and Scientific Calculator?
Question 4=How is code reusability implemented?
